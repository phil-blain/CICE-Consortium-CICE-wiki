# **Welcome to the [CICE](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE) wiki!**
This repository contains the CICE sea ice numerical model starting with version 6, which is now [licensed](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf) for use through the CICE Consortium. 

The column physics portion of the CICE code, 'Icepack', is kept in a separate [Icepack repository](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack). CICE includes Icepack as a git submodule.
