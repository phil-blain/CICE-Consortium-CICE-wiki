# **Welcome to the [CICE](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE) wiki!**
This repository contains the CICE sea ice numerical model starting with version 6. For information on CICE prior to version 6 please see the [CICE-svn-trunk wiki](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk/wiki). 

The column physics portion of the CICE code, 'Icepack', is kept in a separate [Icepack repository](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack). CICE includes Icepack as a git submodule. 

The CICE model for CICE version 6 and later is now [licensed](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf) for use through the CICE Consortium. (**_SHOULD WE MOVE THIS TO THE ABOUT-US REPO?_**)

## Releases  
The [CICE Version Index (post version 6)](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE/wiki/CICE-Versions-Index-post-version-6) of numbered releases of CICE version 6 and later has specific information for each release. Each release is available as branches in this repository or as tarballs.
