**The purpose of providing this sample output is for users to verify their configurations and testing relative to the standards case the Consortium runs. It is not intended for publication.**

## Contents
This sample output is applicable for the CICE version 6.0.2 release and subsequent model releases in which the results are not statistically different from the previous release. When a release has statistically different results, as shown by our testing suite, new sample output will be created for that release.
